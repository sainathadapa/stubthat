## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have changed the format of a sample url (https://example.com/endpoint) from 'link' format to 'verbatim'. This url is not meant to be clicked, and only serves as an example.

## Test environments
* local ubuntu 16.04, R 3.4.0
* r-hub Debian Linux, R-release, GCC
* r-hub Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, R-release, 32/64 bit
* r-hub Debian Linux, R-devel, GCC

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs and NOTEs

## Downstream dependencies

I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies, and the checks passed for all of them.
